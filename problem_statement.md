# Problem statement

I go on lots of countryside walks, and enjoy admiring the flowers as the seasons go by. I would like to document my observations of flowers, and plants in general, in various locations throughout the year.

Every time I see a plant, I would like to record its species, where I saw it, when I saw it, and optionally upload a photograph. 

I would like a dashboard overview where I can see all of my recorded observations, and be able to sort them alphabetically by species and time of observation.

I would like to be able to view, edit, and delete observations as needed.

It would be fantastic if I could search for and autocomplete the location of my observation all in the application.

Some times I don't quite know what I've seen. I'd love to be able to upload a photograph of an observation, and have the application recognise and fill in the species.

I'd like the flexibility of recording observations whenever I want, even if it's a little while after the fact. Filling in time and location information becomes more difficult, so I would like information from photographs I upload to be used to fill in the time and location of the respective observation.

I would also like to be able to see all of my recorded observations presented neatly on a map.

I'd like to access my observations over a wide range of devices, so I would like the application to be a web app.
